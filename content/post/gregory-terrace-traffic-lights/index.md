Moving throughout Brisbane as a pedestrian you are constantly reminded of the blatent prioritisation of motor vehicles over all other forms of travel, especially those walking.


You mostly feel this prioritisation at conflict points where the paths of motor vehicles and pedestrians cross at intersections. More often than not, when a traffic engineer has to balance the scale of a green time of a pedestrian or the amount of time a motor vehicle gets to turn left into their path, the traffic engineer tips the scale in favour of the motor vehicle. 


A prime example of this experience can be found at the intersection of Gregory Terrace and Brunswick Street (Abbortsford Road on one side of the intersection). Pictured in the banner above, however a simplied version of the intersection is pictured below:

![Simplified intersetion at Gregory Terrace](Brunswick_Street.png)

It's a large interection, however it has quite a simple light cycle due to the turning restrictions (only right turns are allowed coming from Abbortford Road into Gregory Terrace) and the two slip lanes reducing conflict points - the light cycle only has three phases.

To simplify the descriptions for the phases I'll be using the following shorthand:
1.  the Street origin of the vehicle (what street it's on when approaching the intersection):
- Abbortford Road (AR)
- Gregory Terrace (GT)
- Brunswick Street (BS)
2. origin position (based on the drawing above):
- Top (T)
- Bottom (B)
- Left (L)
- Right (R)
3. the direction headed from the perspect of the driver:
- Straight (S)
- Turning Left (L)
- Turning Right (R)


This will be displayed in square brackets in the above order separated by commas. If there is a conflict with Pedestrians, an exclamation mark will be used after the array. If it's a sliplane the array will start with a dolalr sign ($). For example, to describe a vehicle on Abbortsford Road originating at the top of the diagram Turning Right into Gregory Terrace with no conflict with pedestrians, this would be described as [AR, T, R].

The observed light cycles for the motor vehicle traffic lights are described below:

| <div style="width:75px">Phase No</div>| <div style="width:60px">Time (s)</div> | <div style="width:80px">Who's Green?</div> | Diagram
|----|----|----|---|
| Phase 1| 15s | [AR, T, S]<br>[AR, T, R]<br>[AR, T, L]!<br>$[BS, B, L]!<br>$[GT, L, L]! | ![Phase 1](Brunswick_Street_Phase_1.png) |
| Phase 2| 45s | [AR, T, S]<br>[AR, T, L]!<br>[BS, B, S] <br>$[BS, B, L]!<br>$[GT, L, L]! | ![Phase 2](Brunswick_Street_Phase_2.png) |
| Phase 3| 15s | [GT, L, S]<br>[GT, R, S]<br>[GT, R , L]! <br>$[BS, B, L]!<br>$[GT, L, L]!| ![Phase 3](Brunswick_Street_Phase_3.png) |

**Note**: For completeness, if no vehicle is detected wanted to turn right from Abbortford Road into Gregory Terrace, Phase 1 does not occur and its time is absorbed into Phase 2 (totalling 60 seconds instead of 45).
