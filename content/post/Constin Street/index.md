Isn't this street super wide?  it's a one-way, one-lane, 15m street!

# Where is it?
- Tivoli
- King Street
- RNA Showgrounds

# Problems

## Visibility for cars coming from Water Street
- You can only partially see the cars coming down
- there is space to move the stop line up



## Insane crossing distances for pedestrians
- compare with Brewers St (down the street)
- 20m at the crossing at Gregory Terrace (one way street!)
- 


# Space could be used much better!

## Tivoli is there - line up takes the entire footpath -put more space for pedestrians to walk by


## Bins blocking footpath

## Contraflow bike lane?

## Benches

## Trees / Shade

# Short Term Cheap Solution
